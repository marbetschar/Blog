Migrating apps from one Cloudron to another works by first creating a new backup of the app on the old Cloudron,Â copying the backup tarball onto the new Clodronâ€™s backup storage and then installing a new app, based on the backup onÂ the new Cloudron.

#### Prerequisites

* Both Cloudrons have to use the same backup encryption key â€“ or none at all ðŸ˜‰
* [Cloudron CLI installed on local machine](https://git.cloudron.io/cloudron/cloudron-cli/)

### The following steps will migrate an app

**#1 Create a backup on the old Cloudron**

    {% highlight bash %}
    $: cloudron login
    $: cloudron list
    $: cloudron backup create --app <appid>
    $: cloudron logout
    {% endhighlight %}

**#2 Copy the new backup from the old Cloudronâ€™s backup storage to the new one**

It depends on your backup solution where your newly created backup is stored. Use the same path for the new Cloudron correspondingly.

**#3 Then login to the new Cloudron and install the new app based on the created backup**

    {% highlight bash %}
    $: cloudron login
    $: cloudron install --appstore-id=org.wordpress.cloudronapp --backup .../...tar.gz
    $: cloudron logout
    {% endhighlight %}
