  * Run out of steam 
      * Lack creativity
      * Didn&#8217;t had have any patience
      * Want to go home at night and not come back in the morning
      * Everything was a chore
      * Not the delight that it had been in the past
  * Tremendous conflict in my staff 
      * I thought it was one guy in particular
      * I thought if I can get rid of him I&#8217;d be fine
      * But I didn&#8217;t had the inner strength to confront him
  * Flat line emotionally 
      * Didn&#8217;t have highs
      * Didn&#8217;t have lows
      * There really wasn&#8217;t much going on inside of me
  * Work has been reduced to a duty 
      * Did what I had to do
      * There was just no joy in doing it
